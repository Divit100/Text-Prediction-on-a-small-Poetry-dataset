# Text-Prediction-on-a-small-Poetry-dataset

In this project,I was able to create a model that predicted text (next 100 words in this case) given a line of text.After training the model,I got an accuracy of 94.4%.

Looking at the model's prediction of next 100 words in the ouput section of the code,we can observe that there are some repeated words,but apart from that,the predicted text does make sense to some extent.
