# Text-Prediction-on-a-small-Poetry-dataset

In this project,I was able to create a model that predicted text (next 100 words in this case) given a line of text.After training the model,I got an accuracy of 94.4%.Looking at the model's prediction of next 100 words,we can observe that there are some repeated words,but apart from that,the predicted text does make sense to some extent.
